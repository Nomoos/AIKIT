'Refactor notes:'
Unnecessary imports: The original code imports several unnecessary namespaces, such as System.Collections.Generic, System.Reflection.Metadata, and static System.Net.WebRequestMethods. These imports are not used in the code and can be removed.

FileStream and StreamReader are not properly disposed: The FileStream and StreamReader objects are not properly disposed after they are used, which can lead to resource leaks and potential performance issues.

Hardcoded file paths: The sourceFileName and targetFileName variables are defined with hardcoded file paths. This can cause issues if the program is moved to a different location on the file system or if the file structure changes.

Input variable is defined inside try block: The input variable is defined inside the try block, which means that it is only accessible within that block. This will cause an error when the code attempts to access it later.

Exception handling is not specific: The catch block just throws the same exception it caught. This is not very informative and it would be better to throw a more specific exception or at least include some logging to provide more context about the error. Additionally, it would be more appropriate to catch IOException or XmlException instead of general Exception.
